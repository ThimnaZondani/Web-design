          <h2>Personal Description</h2>
      
          <p>My personality can be described as being  dynamic, flexible and with proven interpersonal skills.
             Although an introvert I have the the dual ablity to work in a team as well as an individual. I have an appreaciation 
            for the Arts and all things creative which enables my mind to be constantly ready for new challanges in the work place
             and I am also very friendly and easy to approach, which helps in assisting others as well as being relatable.
            I would also describe myself as very articulate and outspoken and self motivated. I am very eager to learn new skills and
             grow both profesionally and as an individual.</p>
